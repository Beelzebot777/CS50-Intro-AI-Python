## Key Topics
1. **Search**: Solving problems by finding solutions from an initial state to a goal state.
   - Examples: solving puzzles, finding routes on a map.
   - Concepts:
     - **State**: The agent's environment configuration.
     - **Actions**: Choices available from a state.
     - **Transition Model**: The relationship between states and actions.
     - **Path Cost**: Metric to evaluate optimal solutions.
     - **Goal**: Desired state.

2. **Knowledge**: Representing and reasoning based on available data.
   - Making inferences from existing information.

3. **Uncertainty**: Using probability to handle uncertain events.

4. **Optimization**: Identifying optimal solutions among multiple options.

5. **Machine Learning**:
   - Training machines to improve tasks based on data.
   - Example: classifying emails as spam.

6. **Neural Networks**:
   - Inspired by the human brain.
   - Used for complex tasks like computer vision.

7. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Understanding and generating human language.

## Search Algorithms
### Basic Algorithms
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Explores the deepest path first before backtracking.
   - Does not guarantee optimal solutions.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Explores states closest to the initial state first.
   - Finds optimal solutions but may require more memory.

### Informed Algorithms
1. **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**:
   - Uses a heuristic to approximate proximity to the goal.
   - Does not always guarantee optimal solutions.

2. **A***:
   - Combines cumulative cost (`g(n)`) and heuristic (`h(n)`).
   - Guarantees optimal solutions if the heuristic is admissible and consistent.

## Adversarial Problems and Games
In problems like tic-tac-toe, the following are introduced:
- **Adversarial Problems**: Two players with opposing goals.
- **Minimax Algorithm**:
  - Max: Attempts to maximize the score.
  - Min: Attempts to minimize the score.
  - Uses recursion to evaluate all possible outcomes.
